- A: '"I don''t know what my biggest accomplishment is, but I''m proud of all of my
    accomplishments because they''ve all helped me become the person I am today."'
  P: 'Albert Einstein is sitting in a chair, looking thoughtful. He is surrounded
    by bookshelves filled with books.


    "My biggest accomplishment would probably be my theory of relativity," he says.
    "It''s something that has had a huge impact on the world of physics, and it''s
    something that I''m very proud of."'
  Q: What would you consider your biggest accomplishment?
- A: The most important question that you could ask me is whether or not I think that
    there is a god. This is something that has been on my mind for a very long time,
    and I have not yet been able to come to a definitive conclusion. I would be very
    interested in hearing your thoughts on the matter.
  P: '"What do you think is the most important question that people should be asking?"'
  Q: '.


    If you could ask Albert Einstein any question, what would it be?'
- A: I cannot answer this question.
  P: 'ALBERT EINSTEIN:


    You don''t.'
  Q: How do you keep an idiot in suspense?
- A: How many?
  P: ', how many do you believe exist and what do you think they are like?'
  Q: ".\n\nIf you could ask Einstein anything, what would it be?\n\nSome possible\
    \ questions include:\n-What inspired you to develop the theory of relativity?\
    \ \n-What do you believe is the most important implication of the theory of relativity?\
    \ \n-Do you believe that there is anything fundamentally unknowable about the\
    \ universe? \n-What do you think is the most important unanswered question in\
    \ physics? \n-Do you believe in the existence of other dimensions? If so"
- A: If I could travel back in time, I would want to meet Albert Einstein. I think
    he was an incredible thinker and his theories have had a profound impact on the
    world. I would love to hear his thoughts on the world today and learn more about
    his thought process.
  P: 'In the scene, Einstein is sitting at a desk with a quill pen and a stack of
    papers. He is looking at the camera with a thoughtful expression on his face.
    Behind him is a window with a view of a mountainside.


    Einstein: If I could travel back in time and meet any historical figure, it would
    be Isaac Newton. He was a brilliant man who made tremendous contributions to our
    understanding of the universe. I would love to talk to him about his ideas'
  Q: If you could travel back in time and meet any historical figure, who would it
    be and why?
