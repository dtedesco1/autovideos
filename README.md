Fun automated video scripts

Pick a famous personâ€™s name (pulled from a spreadsheet or a website UI where anyone can generate a video on the fly)
- ChatGPT API generates interesting questions, responses, and text prompts to create images of the responses
- Stable Diffusion / Midjourney / DALLE API generates relevant images
- Text-to-audio for voiceover
- Some library creates a video (MVP can just be a slideshow of voicover over the appropriate images)
- Uploaded via YouTube API


# In progress! #
*We're still figuring this out and the scripts won't likely work at this point.*
